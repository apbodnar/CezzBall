		<h3>Objective</h3>
		<p>The object of Cezz ball is to clear as much of the level as you can. To clear the area you must draw horizontal or vertical lines.</p> 
		<p><span id="caution">CAUTION</span>: If a ball hits either line while they are being drawn, the line disappears and you lose a life! The line completes when it reaches a wall.</p>
		<p>Lines that finish drawing without getting hit will do one of two things; It will close off an area of the board that does not have any balls in that region, or it will just divide that area, leaving whatever balls are left trapped to continue bouncing.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="instructionsLeft">
		<h3>Game rules</h3>
		<p>To draw lines you will use a left mouse click or right mouse click.</p>
		<p>Left click will draw a horizontal line.</p>
		<p>Right click will draw a vertical line.</p>
